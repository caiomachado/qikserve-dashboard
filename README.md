# Overview

This is part of the screening process for QikServe where I have to build a simple dashboard application

# How to run
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies and run `npm run dev` to start the server locally

# Observations

I had to mock the data returned from the API because of a cors issue, therefore I kept it very simple just to have the data ready to be used.
I kept the project structure very simple due to its simplicity, so there's nothing fancy in folder structure or separation of styles, I did create a separate style sheet for the button just to represent how I would separate my styles when using plain css.

# Extra
I added an ability to filter down the list using the input at the top
